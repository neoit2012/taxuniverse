# Architectural Design Document (ADD)
**Project:** Enterprise Laravel Portal
**Status:** Scaffolding Phase
**Standard:** SOLID / Clean Architecture

## 1. Directory Structure Standards
- **Services:** `app/Services/` - Logic for business operations.
- **Repositories:** `app/Repositories/` - Data access and Eloquent abstraction.
- **DTOs:** `app/DTOs/` - Data Transfer Objects for strict typing.

## 2. Request Flow
Client -> Middleware (Security) -> Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Model -> Database.

## 3. Design Principles
- **Strict Types:** Every file must use `declare(strict_types=1);`.
- **Dependency Injection:** Services injected into Controllers; Repositories injected into Services.
